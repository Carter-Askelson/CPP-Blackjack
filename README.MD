# CPP-Blackjack
Program to play the cardgame of Blackjack in  <C++>

Whenever I'm learning a new programming language I make my own version of Blackjack as a project to put together everything I've learned into it.

# Future Work

* Split Program into different functions
* Maybe put the "class" of the card into the game, not just the values.
